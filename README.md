# Team Submission to IBM Call for Code Global Challenge 2021

## Overview

Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing our team's submission for the IBM Call for Code Global Challenge 2021. We are proud to share our innovative solution that addresses an important challenge using cutting-edge technologies. Our solution, developed with a strong focus on language learning, not only leverages the power of AI and text-to-speech but also integrates IBM Watson services into Unity, creating an immersive language-learning experience.

## IBM Call for Code Global Challenge 2021

The IBM Call for Code Global Challenge is an annual initiative that brings together developers, designers, and problem solvers from around the world to tackle pressing issues using technology. In 2021, the challenge centered around creating sustainable and scalable solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change. Participants were encouraged to develop innovative applications, platforms, and systems that could drive meaningful change and make a positive difference in communities worldwide.

## Our Achievement: Top 4 Solutions in Europe

We are thrilled to announce that our team's submission has been recognized as one of the top 4 solutions in Europe for the IBM Call for Code Global Challenge 2021. This achievement reflects the dedication and hard work put into our solution, and we are honored to have been selected among a highly competitive pool of participants.

## Solution: Immersive Language-Learning Experience with AI and Text-to-Speech

Our solution focuses on revolutionizing language learning through the integration of IBM Watson services into Unity, a powerful game development platform. By leveraging the capabilities of IBM Watson, particularly in the field of natural language processing and text-to-speech synthesis, we have created an immersive language-learning experience that pushes the boundaries of traditional language education.

Through our solution, learners are able to interact with virtual environments and characters, engaging in realistic conversations that enhance their language proficiency. The integration of AI and text-to-speech technologies enables real-time language translation, pronunciation feedback, and interactive dialogue scenarios that adapt to the learner's level of proficiency. This approach not only makes language learning more engaging and personalized but also provides an opportunity for learners to practice in a safe and immersive environment.

## Getting started

The project is currently approximately 80% complete. Some scene optimizations are required to improve the frame rate, and there is a need to connect certain scenes together.

To run and edit the game scenes, follow these steps:

1. Install Unity3D Game Engine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Make sure you have the correct version of Unity installed (Unity Version 2021.1.6f1).
4. Open Unity Hub.
5. Go to the "Projects" tab.
6. Select "Add".
7. Locate the cloned repository and add it to the Unity Hub.
8. Open the game.
9. Edit or play scenes as desired.
